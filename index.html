                            We present Clio, an information flow control (IFC) system that transparently incorporates cryptography to enforce confidentiality and integrity policies on untrusted storage. Clio insulates developers from explicitly manipulating keys and cryptographic primitives by leveraging the policy language of the IFC system to automatically use the appropriate keys and correct cryptographic operations. We prove that Clio is secure with a novel proof technique composing cryptographic proof techniques with standard programming language techniques. We present a prototype Clio implementation along with a case study that demonstrates Clio's practicality.

                            This dissertation presents three enhancements to software components that increase the trustworthiness and usability of the systems they comprise. The enhancements are composable: they are local to the components they enhance and are self-contained. Since they are self-contained and local, composable enhancements can be partially deployed in a system without adversely affecting system behavior. The assurances provided by the enhancements are gradual: as the number of enhanced components in the system increases, the overall assurances provided by the entire system also increases. This dissertation investigates these enhancements in three different settings. In each setting, it identifies an inherent security or functional correctness problem with the components in that setting and provides a composable enhancement that remedies the problem gradually.
                            <p>
                            In the first setting, this dissertation identifies that although modern services expose interfaces that are higher-order in spirit, the simplicity of the network protocols used forces services to rely on brittle encodings. To bridge the semantic gap, this dissertation presents Whip, a higher-order contract system that allows programmers to detect when services do not live up to their advertised higher-order interfaces. As more services use Whip, it becomes easier to identify errant services in the system.
                            <p>
                            In the second setting, this dissertation identifies that in the Disjunction Category label model, capability-like privileges are used to downgrade information, which when used inappropriately can compromise security. To ensure privileges are used as intended, this dissertation presents restricted privileges, an enhancement to privileges to control downgrading based on a specification of security conditions for when they can be legitimately used. As more privileges are restricted, information in the system becomes more protected from the accidental or malicious exercise of privileges to downgrade more information than intended.
                            <p>
                            In the third setting, this dissertation identifies that information-flow control (IFC) programs often need to interact with a key-value store that can also be accessed by non-IFC programs. These non-IFC programs may inadvertently (or maliciously) fail to respect the policies enforced by the IFC programs. In order to ensure the information protected by the IFC programs is not exfiltrated or corrupted by non-IFC programs through the key-value store, this dissertation presents Clio, an extension to a popular IFC language that transparently incorporates cryptography for data on the untrustworthy key-value store. As more IFC programs use Clio, the more information is protected from non-IFC programs in the system.

                            Modern service-oriented applications forgo semantically rich protocols and middleware when composing services. Instead, they embrace the loosely-coupled development and deployment of services that communicate via simple network protocols. Even though these applications do expose interfaces that are higher-order in spirit, the simplicity of the network protocols forces them to rely on brittle low-level encodings. To bridge the apparent semantic gap, programmers introduce ad-hoc and error-prone defensive code. Inspired by Design by Contract, we choose a different route to bridge this gap. We introduce Whip, a contract system for modern services. Whip (i) provides programmers with a higher-order contract language tailored to the needs of modern services; and (ii) monitors services at run time to detect services that do not live up to their advertised interfaces. Contract monitoring is local to a service. Services are treated as black boxes, allowing heterogeneous implementation languages without modification to services' code. Thus, Whip does not disturb the loosely coupled nature of modern services.

                            The programming language Haskell plays a unique, privileged role in Information-Flow Control
                            (IFC) research: it is <em>able to enforce information security via libraries</em>. Many state-of-the-
                            art libraries (e.g., LIO, HLIO, and MAC) allow computations to manipulate data with
                            different security labels by introducing the notion of <em>labeled values</em>, which protect values
                            with explicit labels by means of an abstract data type. While computations have an
                            underlying algebraic structure in such libraries (i.e. monads), there is no research on
                            structures for labeled values and their impact on the programming model. In this paper, we
                            add the <em>functor</em> structure to labeled values, which allows programmers to conveniently and
                            securely perform computations without side-effects on such values, and an <em>applicative</em>
                            operator, which extends this feature to work on multiple labeled values combined by a multi-
                            parameter function. This functionality simplifies code, as it does not force programmers to
                            spawn threads to manipulate sensitive data with side-effect free operations. Additionally,
                            we present a <em>relabel</em> primitive which securely modifies the label of labeled values. This
                            operation also helps to simplify code when aggregating data with heterogeneous labels, as it
                            does not require spawning threads to do so. We provide mechanized proofs of the soundness
                            our contributions for the security library MAC, although we remark that our ideas apply to
                            LIO and HLIO as well.

                            Disjunction Category Labels (DC-labels) are an expressive label format used to classify the
                            sensitivity of data in information-flow control systems. DC-labels use capability-like
                            privileges to downgrade information. Inappropriate use of <em>privileges</em> can compromise
                            security, but DC-labels provide no mechanism to ensure appropriate use. We extend DC-labels
                            with the novel notions of <em>bounded privileges</em> and <em>robust privileges</em>. Bounded privileges
                            specify and enforce upper and lower bounds on the labels of data that may be downgraded.
                            Bounded privileges are simple and intuitive, yet can express a rich set of desirable
                            security policies. Robust privileges can be used only in downgrading operations that are
                            <em>robust</em>, i.e., the code exercising privileges cannot be abused to release or certify more
                            information than intended. Surprisingly, robust downgrades can be expressed in DC-labels as
                            downgrading operations using a weakened privilege. We provide <em>sound and complete</em> run-time
                            security checks to ensure downgrading operations are robust. We illustrate the applicability
                            of bounded and robust privileges in a case study as well as by identifying a vulnerability
                            in an existing DC-label-based application.

                            We present Pidgin, a program analysis and understanding tool that enables the specification
                            and enforcement of precise application-specific information security guarantees. Pidgin also
                            allows developers to interactively explore the information flows in their applications to
                            develop policies and investigate counter-examples.
                            <p>
                            Pidgin combines <em>program-dependence graphs</em> (PDGs), which precisely capture the information flows in a whole application,
                            with a <em>custom PDG query language</em>. Queries express properties about the paths in the PDG; because paths in the PDG
                            correspond to information flows in the application, queries can be used to specify global security policies.
                            <p>
                            Pidgin is scalable. Generating a PDG for a 335k line Java application takes under 90 seconds, and checking each of our
                            policies on that PDG takes under 14 seconds. The query language is expressive, supporting a large class of precise,
                            application-specific security guarantees. Policies are separate from the code and do not interfere with testing or
                            development, and can be used for security regression testing.
                            <p>
                            We describe the design and implementation of Pidgin and report on using it: (1) to explore information security
                            guarantees in legacy programs; (2) to develop and modify security policies concurrently with application development;
                            and (3) to develop policies based on known vulnerabilities.

                            Research on differential privacy is generally concerned with examining data sets that are
                            static. Because the data sets do not change, every computation on them produces "one-shot"
                            query results; the results do not change aside from randomness introduced for privacy.
                            There are many circumstances, however, where this model does not apply, or is simply
                            infeasible. Data streams are examples of non-static data sets where results may change as
                            more data is streamed. Theoretical support for differential privacy with data streams has
                            been researched in the form of differentially private streaming algorithms. In this paper,
                            we present a practical framework for which a non-expert can perform differentially private
                            operations on data streams. The system is built as an extension to PINQ (Privacy Integrated
                            Queries), a differentially private programming framework for static data sets. The streaming
                            extension provides a programmatic interface for the different types of streaming
                            differential privacy from the literature so that the privacy trade-offs of each type of
                            algorithm can be understood by a non-expert programmer

                            A method receives a specification for processing beacons. The beacons are associated with an
                            event occurring at a client while a user is interacting with a web application and include
                            unstructured data. The method parses the specification to determine an object model
                            including objects determined from the specification where different specifications are
                            parsed into a format of the object model. A generator is determined and each generator is
                            configured to process the format of the object model to generate a different type of target
                            program to process the beacons and multiple generators can process different specifications
                            that are parsed into the format of the object model. The method runs the generator with the
                            object model to generate a target program configured to identify the beacons for the
                            specification, determine unstructured data in the beacons that were specified in the
                            specification, and transform the unstructured data into structured data.

                            Fabric is a new system and language for building secure distributed information systems. It
                            is a decentralized system that allows heterogeneous network nodes to securely share both
                            information and computation resources despite mutual distrust. Its high-level programming
                            language makes distribution and persistence largely transparent to programmers. Fabric
                            supports data-shipping and function-shipping styles of computation: both computation and
                            information can move between nodes to meet security requirements or to improve performance.
                            Fabric provides a rich, Java-like object model, but data resources are labeled with
                            confidentiality and integrity policies that are enforced through a combination of compile-
                            time and run-time mechanisms. Optimistic, nested transactions ensure consistency across all
                            objects and nodes. A peer-to-peer dissemination layer helps to increase availability and to
                            balance load. Results from applications built using Fabric suggest that Fabric has a clean,
                            concise programming model, offers good performance, and enforces security.
